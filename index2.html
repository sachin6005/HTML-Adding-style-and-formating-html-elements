                   <p>The Internet is a vast network that connects computers all over the world. Through the Internet,
                       people can share information and communicate from anywhere with an Internet connection.

                   <p>IP allow digital computers to communicate over long distances. The Internet is a packet-switched network, 
                       in which information is broken down into small packets,sent individually over many different routes at
                       the same time, and then reassembled at the receiving end.

                  <p>
                      The Internet is a packet-switched network, in which information is broken down into small packets, 
                      sent individually over many different routes at the same time, and then reassembled at the receiving end.
                      TCP is the component that collects and reassembles the packets of data.

                  <p>
                     Internet service provider (ISP) is a company that provides Internet connections and 
                     services to individuals and organizations.

                 <p>
                    An IP address (internet protocol address) is a numerical representation that uniquely
                    identifies a specific interface on the network.

                 <p>
                   DNS works much like a directory that translates the domain names into IP addresses. Every device 
                   connected to the internet has its own IP address which is used by other devices to locate the device.

                  <p>
                   Domain Name Server (DNS) spoofing (a.k.a. DNS cache poisoning) is an attack in which altered DNS
                   records are used to redirect online traffic to a fraudulent website that resembles its intended destination.

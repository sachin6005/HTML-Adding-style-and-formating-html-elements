             <p style="background-color: rgb(177, 216, 177); padding: 20px;"><i>One of the fundamental procedures of developing software in a step by step manner is by following the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). 
                  SDLC is a popular practice that is followed by different organizations for designing and developing high-quality software applications.
                   It acts as a framework that holds some specific tasks to be achieved at every phase during the software development progression.</i></p>

        <h2 style="background-color: rgb(143, 200, 202); padding: 20px; ">SDLC Consist of 7 phases and a specific task is performed at each phase.</h2>
         <div style="background-color: cornflowerblue; padding: 20px;">
             <h3>First phase: planning phase</h3>
             <p>In this phase, Business analyst gather essential information from customers and plan BRS(Business requirement specification ) for product development.
             The team of designers and BA will do brainstorming and extract all the requirements and plan for the development of the new system.</p>
            </div>
            <div style="background-color: darkkhaki; padding: 20px;">
                <h3>Second phase: Requirement Analysis or Defining phase</h3>
                <p>After BRS documentation is done a group of employees like HR, Financial analyst, Business analyst, Architect, a Project manager will sit jointly, 
                    discuss and analyse how to proceed and whether it is possible in the allotted budget depending upon cost, time resources etc. SRS(software requirement 
                    specification ) documentation is made which contain a detailed explanation of product requirement right from design to development.</p>   
            </div>
            <div style="background-color: gainsboro; padding: 20px;">
                <h3>Third phase: Designing phase</h3>
                <p>SRS document is referred by product architects and they come up with the best architecture for the development of the product. Based on requirements 
                    specified in SRS, multiple designs are proposed and documented in DDS(Design Document specifications).DDS is reviewed by all the stakeholders 
                    and the best design is chosen for the development of the product.</p>
            </div>
             <div style="background-color: ghostwhite; padding: 20px;">
                <h3>Fourth phase: Development or Coding phase</h3>
                <p>In this phase, developers start writing the code. Tasks are divided into units or modules and assigned to the various developers to write the code.
                     The developer needs to follow certain predefined coding guidelines. They also need to use programming tools like compiler, interpreters,
                     debugger to generate and implement the code. This is considered the longest phase of SDLC.</p>
             </div>
         <div style="background-color: khaki; padding: 20px;">
            <h3>Fifth phase: Testing phase</h3>
            <p>As your product is prepared for deployment, it needs a prior testing environment by the test engineers to check for bugs and run-time errors, and 
                they check in this phase whether the functionality of the product is working as per the requirement or not. The bugs or defects which are encountered 
                in the test phase are reported to the developers, who fix the bug and revert to the test engineers for further testing. This is an iterative process 
                that continues until your application is free from bugs and defects and works stably. </p>
         </div>
         <div style="background-color: honeydew; padding: 20px;">
            <h3>Sixth phase: Implementation or Deployment phase</h3>
            <p>Once your product is developed, tested, and completely in working form as per the requirement, and then it is installed or deployed in the customerâ€™s
                 workplace for their use.</p>
         </div>
           
         <div style="background-color:rgb(153, 151, 229) ; padding: 20px;">
            <h3>Seventh phase: Maintenance phase</h3>
            <p>Once the system is deployed, and when customers begin using the product and encounter with some issues which they want developers to fix from time to time.
                 The developer fixes the issue, and software testers test the product and hand it over back to the customer.</p>
